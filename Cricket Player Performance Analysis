This project analyzes the performance of prominent cricket players using historical match data. It combines Python-based data analysis with Power BI dashboards to generate actionable insights for team selection, player comparison, and performance trends.

## 📊 Objective

To assess and visualize player performance (e.g., Virat Kohli, Jos Buttler) across multiple statistical categories and deliver strategic insights using data visualization.

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies

* **Python**: Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn (for data wrangling and EDA)
* **Power BI**: For interactive dashboards and visual comparisons
* **Jupyter Notebook**: Code environment for analysis

---

## 📁 Dataset

The dataset includes player statistics such as:

* Matches played
* Runs scored
* Strike rate
* Batting average
* Bowling economy
* Fielding records (catches/run-outs)

(*Source: Manually collected or scraped from IPL stats websites*)

---

## 🔍 Key Features

* Compare players across 15+ performance metrics
* Identify consistency, peak seasons, and outliers
* Highlight top performers by category (e.g., power hitters, all-rounders)
* Dashboard filters by player, team, and season
